See, the approach in the divide and conquer is that you need to pass the values right but in java there is no refrence passing.
so what you do? you copy the attributes of the object into the parent object. think of the object that you create at every instance as a node.
each and every node is going to have its own elements and the values of these elements is what will be copied. 
You need to divide the code into two parts. that is one small one where the length =1 or 2 and the other, the bigger one where the value is greater than
2. You define the mid element and then you go for recursive call at the mid.
